Audio Helper is a Python library that provides utility functions for processing audio files. It includes features like loading audio, converting formats, separating audio sources, and splitting and concatenating audio files.

# Installation

## Install Package

We recommend using Python environments. Check this link if you're unfamiliar with setting one up:

[ü•∏ Tech tips](https://harchaoui.org/warith/4ml/#install)

To install Audio Helper, run:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/warith-harchaoui/audio-helper.git@main
```

# Usage
Here‚Äôs an example of how to use Audio Helper to load, convert, and split an audio file:

```python
import audio_helper as ah

# Load an audio file
audio_file = "example.mp3"
audio, sample_rate = ah.load_audio(audio_file)

# Convert the audio file to a different format
output_audio = "example.wav"
ah.sound_converter(audio_file, output_audio)

# Split the audio file into chunks of 30 seconds
chunks = ah.split_audio_regularly(audio_file, "chunks_folder", split_time=30.0)

# Concatenate the chunks back together
new_concatenated_audio = "concatenated.wav"
concatenated_audio = ah.audio_concatenation(chunks, output_audio_filename = new_concatenated_audio)
```

# Features
- Audio Loading: Load audio files with optional resampling and mono conversion.
- Sound Conversion: Convert audio files to different formats using ffmpeg.
- Source Separation: Separate an audio file into vocals, drums, bass, and other stems using a pre-trained PyTorch model (Demucs).
- Audio Splitting: Split audio files into chunks based on duration.
- Concatenation: Concatenate multiple audio files into one.
- Silent Audio Generation: Create silent audio files of a specified duration.
- Chunk Extraction: Extract specific segments from an audio file.
